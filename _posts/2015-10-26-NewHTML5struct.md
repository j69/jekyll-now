By using just 5 elements (aside, footer, header, main and nav)  available in HTML5 you can provide the understanding and navigation benefits of content organisation to users who would otherwise not be able to perceive it from the visual cues alone:


```html
<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<main><main>
<aside></aside>
<footer></footer>
```

Page layout with header at top, nav on right side, main in the middle, aside on right side and footer at bottom.
