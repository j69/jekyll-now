So, there is the point:
60-80% of your work-time is for understanding the code. It`s including an understanding your code, a movement through code structure. There is no help from the Editor in this period. One click of your mouse can save you 10 minutes of code archeology:).

On another hand, Editor is for the small projects, some local tasks when you need to edit a couple of lines. Also, in certain specific areas (such as low-level development for linux or assembling or just csv/xml files) all the required code are usually in one or two files. There's just nothing to do with the IDE.
