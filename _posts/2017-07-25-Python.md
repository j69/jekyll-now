In the end PHP will become Python.

First it will remove all obsolete duplicating operators and functions such as:
* 'switch' and 'do ... while'
* bunch of "echo, print***, var_dump" instead of just "print"
* a wide range of byte-code caches available instead of ONE COMPILATED cache

 Then it will remove curly braces and dollar signs and "->"-s

 Next one is confused tableau of function names. The builtin library has a wide variety of naming conventions. Functions often have prefixes to denote their source (but often not). Functions are often placed into classes to simulate namespaces.

 And in the end it will get rid of a somewhat weak type system (not to be confused with dynamic types)
