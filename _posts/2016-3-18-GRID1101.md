GRiD Compass 1101 is the grand-daddy of all present-day laptop computers.

[Such a nice brick](http://oldcomputers.net/grid1101.html)

But GRiD-OS is no slouch - the suite includes: 
- GRiDManager 	-communication and utility functions
- GRiDPrint	-control format and appearance of text files
- GRiDWrite	-full-screen text editor
- GRiDPlan	-electronic worksheets
- GRiDFile	-database facilities
- GRiDPlot	-converts data to graphs
- GRiDBASIC	-programming language

Controlled almost entirely my menus, GRiD-OS is a full-function, powerful operating system. It displays data by DEVICE, SUBJECT (folder), TITLE (file name), and KIND (file type). Files can be password protected if desired.
