##  MISSION STATEMENT
Your code is only as good as its weakest part. This is my main principle and motto. I care primarily on the quality of the code. I would like to work with professionals as to exchange experience and learn all the time.

I have always been interested in programming and computers which was why I chose to follow this career path. As a senior programmer I was responsible for planning and implementing web applications and software development. Moreover, I was writing technical & project documentation, designing and optimizing databases and source code.

## What are your strengths?

* I’m a perfectionist. I pay attention to all the details, and like to be sure that everything is just right.

* I’m a creative thinker. I like to explore alternative solutions to problems and have an open mind about what will work best.

* To take initiative – to do something without having to be told to do it. When I work, I always take initiative. If I see something that needs doing, I don’t wait for instruction, I do it. I believe that to be get anywhere in life, you need this quality.

## What are your weaknesses?

I spend too much time on projects which makes you work slower. Turn that into a positive by saying: I sometimes am slower in completing my tasks compared to others because I really want to get things right. I will double or sometimes triple-check documents and files to make sure everything is accurate (correct).

## Where do you see yourself 5 years from now?

After the five year I want be get respectable position in organization. After getting more experience I want to take part to making important decision for organization.

###  Why Should We Hire You?

Three reasons: I meet deadlines, I deliver on what I promised, and as a result I always make my managers to be proud of me.

I work well under pressure. When there is a deadline, I can focus on the task at hand (current project) and structure my work schedule well. I remember one week when I had to get 6 new customer reports out by Friday at 5. I finished all the reports ahead of time without having to work overtime.

I am a trouble shooter. When there was a problem at my last job, the manager would always ask me to solve it. Last summer, the server at work crashed. The manager was desperate and called me in (requested my help) to get the server back online. After taking a look at the daily backup, I detected the problem and the server was up and running (working) within the hour.
